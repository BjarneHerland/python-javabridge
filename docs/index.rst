javabridge: running and interacting with the JVM from Python
===================================================================

The javabridge Python package makes it easy to start a Java virtual machine (JVM) from Python and interact with it. Python code can interact with the JVM using a low-level API or a more convenient high-level API.

The javabridge was developed for `CellProfiler
<http://cellprofiler.org/>`_, where it is used together with `python-bioformats <http://github.com/CellProfiler/python-bioformats/>`_ to interface to various Java code, including `Bio-Formats <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats>`_ and `ImageJ <http://developer.imagej.net/>`_.
